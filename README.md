ðŸš—Vehicle Speed Tracking & Counting Using YOLOv8 and AI

Have you ever wondered how AI can measure vehicle speed and count cars automatically? Today, Iâ€™m sharing an advanced project that uses YOLOv8 to detect, track, and measure vehicle speeds in pixels per second, while also checking for speed violations

Technologies Used: âœ… YOLOv8 for vehicle detection (Cars ðŸš—, Buses ðŸšŒ, Trucks ðŸš›) âœ… OpenCV for video processing and object tracking âœ… Python for speed calculation and data analysis

How It Works: ðŸ”¹ Vehicle Detection & Tracking: The model processes a real-world traffic video, detects vehicles, and tracks their movements. ðŸ”¹ Speed Calculation: ðŸ“Œ When a vehicle crosses Line 1, the entry time is recorded. ðŸ“Œ When it crosses Line 2 , speed is calculated using: Speed = Distance / Time (in pixels per second). ðŸ”¹ Speed Violation Detection: If a vehicle exceeds 60 px/s, it gets labeled as OVERSPEED in red ðŸš¨. ðŸ”¹ Vehicle Counting: The program keeps track of the total number of vehicles that passed both lines.

Real-Time Display Features: While running, the system shows: âœ… Unique ID for each vehicle âœ… Real-time speed tracking âœ… Speed violations highlighted in red ðŸš¨ âœ… Total vehicle count on-screen

This project is a great step in AI-powered Computer Vision If you find it interesting, share it with AI enthusiasts
